# ToDo/Scheduler App
1) A Todo/Scheduler Android app.
2) Made with React Native + SQLite + redux + detox
3) The idea of this app was to create a simple clean and clear Calendar/ToDo/Scheduler app the way I like it. Key feature of it being its simplicity as all of the existing similar apps UI would be way too clustered for me, 
with million of feature buttons that were unnassociated with the simple idea of "just add a task" so not really enjoyable to use.
5) The minimum of features that i wanted for it are actually working so i am currently using it. But Notifications & Alarms on a released version don't seem to be working properly and a big refactor would be needed to release this app.
6) The free time that i had dedicated to make this app had run out and it has been left in a state as it is.
